## ðŸ¤”Introduction

Writing sidenote would be helpful while taking notes, writing articles, or even writing code. This plugin allows you to insert and manage sidenotes in your Neovim buffer. It uses a SQLite database to store the sidenotes (based on [sqlite.lua](https://github.com/kkharji/sqlite.lua)), so you can easily restore them later.

The sidenote would highly configured for being compatible with folding text and CJK charactors (which always unrealized in neovim).


## ðŸ› Installation

```lua
return {
  "pxwg/sidenote.nvim",
  event = "VeryLazy",
  dependencies = {
    { "kkharji/sqlite.lua" }, --- database for storing notes
  },
  --- @type SideNoteOpts
  opts = {
    input = {
      title = "Input",
      win_opts = {
        relative = "cursor",
        style = "minimal",
        border = "rounded",
        title_pos = "center",
      },
    },
    virtual_text = {
      hl_group = "Comment",
      upper_connector = "â”Œâ”€",
