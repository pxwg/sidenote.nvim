# sidenote.nvim: Generate and manage your sidenotes in Neovim

*WIP*: This plugin is still in development. The basic functionality is there, but there are still some bugs and missing features. There are many possible breaking changes. Be free to PR!

## ðŸ› Installation

Use your favorite plugin manager. For example, with `lazy.nvim`:

return {
  "pxwg/sidenote.nvim",
  event = "VeryLazy",
  dependencies = {
    { "kkharji/sqlite.lua" }, --- database for storing notes
  },
  opts = {
    input = {
      title = "Input",
      win_opts = {
        relative = "cursor",
        style = "minimal",
        border = "rounded",
        title_pos = "center",
      },
    },
    virtual_text = {
      hl_group = "Comment",
    },
  },
}
```
